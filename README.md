# PicASCII
IRC bot which displays ASCII images.

Depends on a Ubuntu font being in the working directory - at the moment this must be modified manually in "ascii_converter.py" to point to a font on your system.

Improvements:
- Use a more fertile source of images (perhaps Google images).
- Improve ASCII art! In particular there are currently issues rendering images which high-intensity backgrounds (in the dog image below the boundary between subject and background is indistinct).

#Samples:
![StarTrek image](SampleOutput/Startrek.png "Guess who?")
![Dog](SampleOutput/Dog.png "Chihuahua")
